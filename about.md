I'm Mathias KÃ¶hnke, a Software Engineer living in [Hamburg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg).

I use this site mainly as a notepad for findings or things I repeatedly use.

## About This Site

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a _static site generator_, in combination with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host this webpage. Posts are written in [Markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org) and put in a [Git](https://git-scm.com) repository for change tracking.
